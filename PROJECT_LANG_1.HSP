write "I decided to make FLOW-MATIC the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-FLOW-MATIC) as FLOW-MATIC is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the FLOW-MATIC programming language. It only makes sense to FLOW-MATIC the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
